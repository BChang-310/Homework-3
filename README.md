# PGE310 Fall 2021 Homework 3

This homework is divided into 2 parts: 

  - In Problem 1 you will practice plotting while using a fun linear algebra
        application, the rotation matrix.
  - Problem 2 will help you practice indexing and slicing NumPy arrays in
        1D, 2D, and 3D.

Please submit this assignment as a Python file (.py) on Github classroom.
For more comprehensive instructions on how to test and submit your code,
refer to the posted instructions document on Canvas.

Indexing and slicing can be tricky, even for seasoned Python pros, but it's one
of the most useful skills to learn! And as always, we're here to help!

Feel free to contact Dr. P, Alex, Bernie, or Ziming with problems, questions, or comments.
